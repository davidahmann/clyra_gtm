Clyra Pre-Launch Content Strategy: "The Evidence Revolution"

  8-Week Tension-Building Campaign

  ---
  Why Pre-Launch Content is Essential

  The Problem with Cold Launches

  - No context - Developers don't understand the problem you're solving
  - No trust - You appear as "another vendor" rather than a thought leader
  - No pipeline - Launch day brings traffic but no warm prospects
  - No feedback - You can't refine messaging before it matters

  The Power of Pre-Launch Priming

  - Problem awareness - Educate market on evidence vs. observability gap
  - Thought leadership - Become the expert before revealing the solution
  - Community trust - Build relationships through value-first content
  - Message testing - Refine positioning based on real engagement
  - Launch amplification - Turn readers into launch-day advocates

  Campaign Theme: "The Great Observability Lie"

  Core Tension Narrative

  Week 1-2: "Your monitoring shows everything" (false comfort)Week 3-4: "But can you prove what
  actually happened?" (reveal gap)Week 5-6: "Forensic evidence vs. symptom detection" (establish
  need)Week 7-8: "The solution exists..." (build anticipation)

  Day 3: "Postgres WAL LSN = immutable sequence number.
         Much better forensic anchor than timestamps."
