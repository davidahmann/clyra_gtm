Clyra v4.0 Pre-Launch Content Strategy: "The Data Governance Revolution"

  8-Week Data Platform Tension-Building Campaign

  ---
  Why Pre-Launch Content is Essential

  The Problem with Cold Launches

- No context - Developers don't understand the problem you're solving
- No trust - You appear as "another vendor" rather than a thought leader
- No pipeline - Launch day brings traffic but no warm prospects
- No feedback - You can't refine messaging before it matters

  The Power of Pre-Launch Priming

- Problem awareness - Educate market on data change control vs. observability gap
- Thought leadership - Become the expert in data platform governance before revealing solution
- Community trust - Build relationships through dbt and warehouse expertise
- Message testing - Refine SOX compliance messaging based on real engagement
- Launch amplification - Turn data engineers into launch-day advocates

  Campaign Theme: "The Data Governance Gap"

  Core Tension Narrative

  Week 1-2: "Your dbt docs and warehouse logs show everything" (false comfort)
  Week 3-4: "But can you prove data changes were approved?" (reveal SOX compliance gap)
  Week 5-6: "Schema change control vs. monitoring alerts" (establish need)
  Week 7-8: "The data governance solution exists..." (build anticipation)
