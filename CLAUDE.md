Clyra v4.0 Project Manifest (Data-Led, Agent-Ready) — SKU-Aligned

Business Case (enhanced)

One control point, three strategic guarantees:
• Clyra Gateway (SchemaLock + Data Firewall, powered by Guard): Stops unsafe data changes, malformed outputs, GenAI threats (fail-closed, OWASP LLM-tagged, deepfake/BEC-classified).
• Clyra Recorder (Flight Data Recorder): Proves and replays every change across data platforms and automation, producing tamper-evident evidence bundles (DEF v0 + PEF v0).
• Clyra Compliance Engine: Multi-framework attestations (SOX ITGC + PCI/HIPAA + EU AI Act/NIST + TCPA) with independent verification.
Tagline: Data Change Control & Attestation for Modern Pipelines

Product Packaging (SKUs 1–7)
• Visus by Clyra — Review (Data Platform): Listen-only detection and evidence (dbt + warehouses), attested tickets, badges, daily review; Financial Close & PCI 4.0 packs with Workiva/AuditBoard exports; AI Firewall + GenAI Defense in shadow; Replay (DEF).
• Lumyn by Clyra — Verify Portal (Free): Hosted verification pages and Slack/PR sharing built on TCK-certified Go/TS verifiers with SSO-gated badges and auditor exports (Workiva/AuditBoard).
• Gate by Clyra — Enforcement (Data), powered by Guard: Allow/deny/HITL, approval certs (RFC 8785), idempotency, velocity, fences, SQL safety (advisory), freeze windows + TTL exceptions, kill-switch; two-way ServiceNow/Jira; activation & iPaaS enforcement; Snowflake AI guard pushdown; CI/CD gates; Replay for checks/forensics.
• Atlas by Clyra — Attribution: Outcome Ledger + Attribution Certificates; deterministic linkage from evidence to business metrics; shadow billing simulations (no money movement).
• Voice by Clyra — Conversation Compliance (Pilot): TCPA disclaimers, session correlation, UCaaS integration, barge-in; metadata-only privacy; runs on Guard.
• Relia by Clyra — Semantics (Open Control Plane, OSS-first): semantics.yaml + policy.yaml → native artifacts (Snowflake DDM/RAP, Unity views/UDFs, Trino filters) with signed decision receipts; semantic API.
• Airlock by Clyra — MCP (Conditional): MCP proxy (dry-run → enforce), OAuth Token Exchange (RFC 8693), DPoP, reverse tunnel, signed allowlists, HITL; PEF+MCP receipts; Replay for MCP.

GenAI security extensions: deepfake detection, BEC-grade approvals, prompt injection heuristics, voice session compliance, external detector APIs, multi-trigger kill-switch.
Data platform integrations: dbt hooks, warehouse anchors (Snowflake/Databricks/Postgres; BigQuery fast-follow), activation gateway, SQL safety guards, semantic delta tracking.
Voice/conversation compliance: TCPA disclaimer enforcement, UCaaS correlation, session management, barge-in capabilities.
Self-serve PLG motion: webhook listen → ServiceNow ticket → badge earned → SOX compliance artifacts in <30 min.
Progressive Adoption Path: Review (listen-only) → Gate (enforcement) → Atlas (attribution) → [H2 Billing].
Governance pillars embedded in every bundle: Reliability · Transparency · Accuracy · Oversight.

Project Overview (v4.0)

Clyra is an OSS data change control and attestation layer for modern data pipelines — from data pipelines to AI agents, dbt/ETL, reverse-ETL, RPA, SaaS integrations, microservices.

SKU coverage in architecture:
• Visus (Review) and Gate (Enforcement) are primary for data platform.
• Lumyn (Verify) is free, hosted verification over OSS verifiers.
• Atlas (Attribution) extends evidence to outcomes.
• Voice (Pilot) applies the same enforcement/evidence to conversation compliance.
• Relia (Semantics, OSS) defines semantics/policies once, enforces everywhere; decision receipts.
• Airlock (Conditional) ports enforcement/evidence to MCP agent-tooling flows.

Data Platform Core (NEW):
• dbt Integration: on_run_start/end hooks emit DEF v0 bundles; CI gates; SQL safety macros enforce approval tokens.
• Warehouse Anchors: Snowflake (QUERY_HISTORY + session tags), Databricks (Delta commits + Unity Catalog), Postgres (WAL LSN + REPEATABLE READ). BigQuery (Audit Logs) fast-follow.
• Activation Gateway: HTTP proxy for reverse-ETL (Hightouch/Census/RudderStack) and iPaaS connectors (Workato/Zapier/Make) with enforcement primitives.
• DEF v0 Format: Data Evidence Format with warehouse-native anchoring, semantic delta tracking, SOX ITGC compliance.

Universal Foundation (Enhanced):
