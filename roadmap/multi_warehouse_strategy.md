# Clyra Multi-Warehouse Strategy

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-31
**Status:** Active Hedge Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

**Primary Thesis:** dbt + SOX + Snowflake is the best first wedge for fast, budget-backed traction.

**Strategic Question:** Is this the only winning combo, or should we hedge?

**Answer:** It's the strongest lead, but not universally dominant. We need fast-follow support for BigQuery and Databricks to avoid losing hot leads and maximize market coverage.

---

## Why dbt + SOX + Snowflake is the Primary Wedge

### Budget & Urgency
- SOX sits with finance/audit and shows up in board timelines (quarter-end/IPO deadlines)
- **Immediate pain + budget authority** = fastest path to revenue
- Controllers have $50-200k discretionary budget for compliance tools

### Standardized Surface
- **dbt:** Uniform hooks/tests/exposures across all deployments
- **Snowflake:** Clean lineage anchors (QUERY_HISTORY, Access History)
- **Together:** Ship listen-only â†’ attested ticket in days (not weeks)

### Complementary Positioning
- We're an **independent attestation/enforcement layer**
- We don't compete with dbt/Snowflakeâ€”we make their outputs audit-grade
- "Your dbt/Snowflake work, now provable to auditors"

### Market Evidence
- **Data platform stack share:**
  - Snowflake: ~40% of data warehouse market (pre-IPO/public companies)
  - dbt: ~70% of transformation tool market (where analytics engineering exists)
  - SOX: 100% of public companies + pre-IPO (12-18 months out)

## Where Other Warehouse Combos Win

### dbt + SOX + BigQuery ðŸŸ¢ FAST-FOLLOW (High Priority)

**When it wins:**
- Google-first shops (adtech, media, consumer apps, gaming)
- Organizations with deep GCP commitment
- ML-heavy teams using Vertex AI + BigQuery together

**Market characteristics:**
- **Stack share:** ~30% of data warehouse market
- **Budget authority:** Same as Snowflake (finance/audit owns SOX)
- **Integration complexity:** Similar to Snowflake (Audit Logs vs. QUERY_HISTORY)
- **Time-to-value:** Nearly identical to Snowflake primary wedge

**Why this is strong:**
- BigQuery Audit Logs provide equivalent anchoring to Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY
- dbt works identically on both platforms
- SOX urgency is the same
- **Risk if we don't support:** Lose 30% of addressable market

**Fast-Follow Timeline:**
- **Month 3-6 post-MVP:** Add BigQuery anchoring
- **Engineering effort:** 2-3 weeks (reuse 90% of Snowflake logic)
- **Expected conversion:** Same as Snowflake (Review â†’ Gate 30%)

---

### dbt + SOX + Databricks ðŸŸ¡ COMPATIBLE (Medium Priority)

**When it wins:**
- ML/lakehouse-heavy enterprises
- Organizations with heavy Spark usage
- Data science-first culture (not analytics engineering-first)

**Market characteristics:**
- **Stack share:** ~20% of data warehouse/lakehouse market
- **Budget authority:** Mixed (data science + finance/audit)
- **Integration complexity:** Moderate (Delta commits + Unity Catalog)
- **Time-to-value:** Slower (governance story "owned" by platform)

**Why this is strategic but not urgent:**
- Databricks has stronger native governance story (Unity Catalog)
- Longer sales cycles (more platform overlap concerns)
- Still valuable market but requires more positioning work

**Compatible Timeline:**
- **Month 6-9 post-MVP:** Add Databricks Delta commit anchoring
- **Engineering effort:** 3-4 weeks (Unity Catalog lineage integration)
- **Expected conversion:** Lower initially (20-25% Review â†’ Gate)

**Positioning strategy:**
- Lead with Review SKU (attested tickets) first
- Promise Gate enforcement later (after trust built)
- Emphasize **independent verification** (auditors don't trust vendor-only logs)

---

### Airflow/Dagster + SOX + Snowflake/BigQuery ðŸ”µ FOLLOW-ON

**When it wins:**
- Orchestration-centric teams (data engineering > analytics engineering)
- Heterogeneous pipeline landscapes (not dbt-native)
- Custom transformation logic (Python > SQL)

**Market characteristics:**
- **Integration complexity:** Higher (less standardized surface)
- **Time-to-value:** Slower (heterogeneity creates edge cases)
- **Budget authority:** Data engineering (not finance/audit directly)

**Why this is follow-on, not primary:**
- Orchestration tools have wider variance in implementation
- Integration lift is heavier (custom hooks per workflow type)
- Slower time-to-value = harder to prove ROI quickly

**Timeline:**
- **Month 9-12 post-MVP:** Add Airflow/Dagster operators
- **Engineering effort:** 4-6 weeks (operator development + testing)
- **Use case:** Expansion within existing customers (land via dbt, expand to orchestration)

---

### Non-SOX Anchors (SOC2/ISO/HIPAA/PCI) ðŸŸ£ VERTICAL PACKS

**When they win:**
- Healthcare (HIPAA critical, SOX less relevant)
- Payment processors (PCI-DSS primary)
- SaaS vendors (SOC2 for customer trust)

**Market characteristics:**
- **Budget authority:** Security/IT (not finance/audit)
- **Procurement cycle:** Longer (security reviews + legal)
- **Urgency:** Lower (no board-driven deadlines like IPO)

**Why these are packs, not primary wedge:**
- Slower procurement cycles
- Budget sits with teams with longer evaluation processes
- SOX urgency creates faster path to initial revenue

**Timeline:**
- **Month 12-18:** Package compliance overlays
- **Positioning:** Upsell to existing SOX customers ("extend to HIPAA")
- **Revenue model:** Add-on packs ($5-10k/year per framework)

---

## Market Segmentation by Warehouse

- Longer sales cycle (6-9 months vs. 3-6 months)

**Win Rate:** 40-50% (positioning as complementary, not competitive)

**Pricing:** May need discount for initial adoption (Review $20-50k)

---

### Postgres/Other (10% market share)

**Ideal Customer Profile:**
- Smaller teams (<200 employees)
- Budget constraints
- Self-hosted/OSS-first culture
- Pilot/POC opportunity

**Win Rate:** 30-40% (lower ACV, longer support burden)

**Pricing:** Community tier or small business discount

## Decision Routing Questions

In discovery calls, ask these three questions **immediately:**

### 1. "Do you run dbt for financial/board-facing models?"
- **Yes + SOX urgency** â†’ Primary wedge applies
- **Yes + no SOX** â†’ Still valuable, longer cycle
- **No** â†’ Orchestration follow-on (defer to later)

### 2. "What's your primary warehouseâ€”Snowflake / BigQuery / Databricks?"
- **Snowflake** â†’ MVP ready, full speed ahead
- **BigQuery** â†’ Fast-follow (Month 3-6), can pre-sell
- **Databricks** â†’ Compatible (Month 6-9), Review SKU first
- **Other** â†’ Assess fit vs. engineering investment

### 3. "Are you public or pre-IPO? SOX timeline?"
- **Pre-IPO (12-18mo out)** â†’ Highest urgency, budget unlocked
- **Recently public (first 2 years)** â†’ Active SOX pain, proven budget
- **Mature public** â†’ Existing process, harder to displace
- **Private, no IPO plans** â†’ Lower priority (focus on others first)

## Competitive Positioning by Warehouse

### vs. Snowflake Native Governance
- **Their story:** "We have audit logs and access history"
- **Our story:** "Independent verificationâ€”auditors don't trust vendor-only logs"
- **Key difference:** We're neutral; they can't audit themselves

### vs. Databricks Unity Catalog
- **Their story:** "We have built-in governance and lineage"
- **Our story:** "Complement Unity Catalog with independent attestation and enforcement"
- **Key difference:** We provide vendor-neutral evidence + progressive enforcement

### vs. BigQuery Audit Logs
- **Their story:** "Audit logs capture everything"
- **Our story:** "Turn logs into signed, portable evidence auditors can verify offline"
- **Key difference:** Logs â‰  evidence; we provide cryptographic proof

---

## Bottom Line

**Primary Bet:** dbt + SOX + Snowflake is the strongest lead for fast revenue and proven budget authority.

**Strategic Hedge:** Add BigQuery support by Month 6 (captures 70% of market vs. 40% Snowflake-only).

**Databricks Compatible:** Add by Month 9 as complementary positioning (captures 90% of market).

**Moat:** The real defensibility isn't the warehouse trio itselfâ€”it's our **independent, portable evidence + progressive enforcement** that rides on whichever warehouse the customer has today.

**Risk Mitigation:** Fast-follow approach prevents us from losing 60% of qualified leads while maintaining focus on the proven primary wedge.
