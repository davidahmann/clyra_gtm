Short answer: I’m confident dbt + SOX + Snowflake is the best primary wedge for fast, budget-backed traction—but it’s not the only winning combo in all contexts. No single trio “beats everything” across the entire market. Here’s the nuanced, pragmatic take:

Why this trio is your best first bet
 • Budget & urgency now: SOX sits with finance/audit and shows up in board timelines (quarter/IPO). That’s immediate pain + money.
 • Standardized surface: dbt gives uniform hooks/tests/exposures; Snowflake gives clean lineage anchors (QUERY_HISTORY/Access History). Together, you can ship listen-only → attested ticket in days.
 • Complementary positioning: You’re an independent attestation/enforcement layer; you don’t compete with dbt/Snowflake—your receipts make their outputs audit-grade.

Where other trios can win (and when)
 • dbt + SOX + BigQuery: In Google-first shops (adtech, media, consumer apps), BigQuery is the warehouse of record. Their Audit Logs make anchoring feasible. This can be just as strong—worth a fast-follow to avoid losing deals.
 • dbt + SOX + Databricks (Delta/Unity Catalog): In ML/lakehouse-heavy enterprises, Databricks is dominant. Anchoring to Delta commits/Unity Catalog is doable, but the governance story is “owned” more by the platform, so sales cycles can be longer, and you risk category overlap. Good expansion, not the fastest initial wedge.
 • Airflow/Dagster + SOX + Snowflake/BigQuery: Works where orchestration is the power center, but heterogeneity is high; integration lift is heavier; time-to-value slower. Solid follow-on once you’ve landed via dbt.
 • Non-SOX anchors (SOC2/ISO/HIPAA/PCI): Viable in specific verticals (healthcare, card-present), but urgency/budget tend to sit with Security/IT and procurement is slower. Great as packs after you’ve landed the SOX wedge.

What this means for your roadmap
 • Keep dbt + SOX + Snowflake as the MVP spearhead.
 • Hedge with two fast-follow anchors so you don’t lose hot leads:
 • BigQuery audit-log anchor (dbt + SOX + BigQuery).
 • Databricks Delta commit anchor (dbt + SOX + Databricks) as a lighter “compat” path first, deeper later.
 • Use the same receipts/attestation across all—just swap the warehouse anchor.

How to de-risk the bet quickly
 • In discovery, ask three routing questions up front:
 1. “Do you run dbt for financial/board-facing models?”
 2. “What’s your primary warehouse—Snowflake / BigQuery / Databricks?”
 3. “Are you public/pre-IPO (SOX timelines)?”
 • If the answers are dbt + Snowflake + (pre-IPO/public), your MVP hit rate is highest.
 • If it’s dbt + BigQuery, you can still close with the BigQuery fast-follow.
 • If it’s Databricks-centric, land the Review SKU (attested tickets) first; promise Gate later.

Bottom line
 • Yes—dbt + SOX + Snowflake is a winning lead combo for a big swath of the market (fastest time-to-value, budgeted urgency, low integration drama).
 • No—it’s not universally unbeatable. That’s why you keep BigQuery (near-parity) and Databricks (compat-to-depth) in the plan as early hedges.
 • The real moat isn’t the trio itself; it’s your independent, portable evidence + progressive enforcement that rides on whichever warehouse the customer has today.
