⚡ High-Lift / High-Impact Prioritization

Top-Right: High Fit, High Difficulty (must-do later)
 1. Proof-of-Task → Settlement Fabric
 • 🔥 Strategic core: bridges receipts to money, your endgame.
 • 🚧 Heavy lift: connectors to Stripe/Visa/ERP + regulatory sign-off.
 • 📌 Do once you’ve locked receipts as the standard.
 2. Agent Runtime Instrumentation SDK (Deep)
 • 🔥 Defines you as the “black box recorder” for agents.
 • 🚧 Hard because every framework evolves fast (LangGraph, Autogen, CrewAI, etc.).
 • 📌 Do once dbt/Snowflake and gateway adoption are solid.

 3. Unified Auditor Portal (Evidence Cloud)
 • 🔥 If Big Four buy in, you become default AI audit interface.
 • ⚖️ Medium-high lift (UX, SOC2/ISO, trust infra), but no blockchain plumbing.
 • 📌 Do as Series A flagship, credibility anchor.
 4. Postgres/Mooncake “Real-Time Enforcement Tap” (extended)
 • 🔥 Keeps you relevant as Databricks collapses pipelines.
 • ⚖️ Hard but focused (logical decoding, schema drift enforcement).
 • 📌 Build after SOX dbt+Snowflake pack → show you can govern “hyperfluid” agents.

⸻

Bottom-Right: Medium Fit, High Difficulty (watchlist)
 5. Consent & Provenance Layer for Media (C2PA)
 • 💡 Aligns with Sora/agentic media, but secondary vs. your SOX/finance wedge.
 • 🚧 Heavy integrations + legal frameworks.
 • 📌 Keep as hedge if you move into creative/brand-heavy verticals.
 6. Real-Time Kill-Switch Mesh
 • 💡 Differentiates from observability; but overlaps with security vendors (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto).
 • 🚧 Hard distributed infra problem, false-positive risk.
 • 📌 Later-stage defensive moat, not wedge.

⸻

Bottom-Left: Medium Fit, Medium Difficulty (nice-to-haves later)
 7. Enterprise Policy Workbench (Visual IDE)
 • 💡 Expands reach to risk/compliance managers; not core wedge but upsell.
 • ⚖️ Medium lift (UI + policy compiler).
 • 📌 Add once you’ve nailed CLI + YAML adoption.
 8. Compliance Overlay Packs Marketplace
 • 💡 Strong ecosystem move, fits long-term, but not MVP critical.
 • ⚖️ Medium-high lift (ecosystem curation, legal).
 • 📌 Series B+ scale play, after core product is trusted.
 9. Integration into Core Enterprise Platforms (SAP/Workday)
 • 💡 Critical for procurement stickiness, but extremely heavy GTM.
 • ⚖️ Long cycle, heavy lift.
 • 📌 Pursue opportunistically via SI partners, not core roadmap early.
 10. Receipt Ledger Anchored to Public Chains

 • 💡 Boosts credibility, but not urgent.
 • ⚖️ Relatively straightforward tech, but regulatory education is slow.
 • 📌 Add later for optionality / enterprise trust, when receipts already standard.
