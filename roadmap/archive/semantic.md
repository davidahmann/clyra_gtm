Open Control Plane ‚Äì MVP (v0.1)

üìñ Description

Clyra Open Control Plane is an open-source, neutral semantics + policy layer for multi-engine data estates. It unifies metric definitions and access policies across Snowflake, Databricks, Trino, and Iceberg catalogs, and produces auditable evidence receipts for every enforcement decision.

It is not a new catalog, BI tool, or discovery crawler. Instead, it sits above existing catalogs and engines, compiling policies and semantics into native artifacts, and logging tamper-proof receipts auditors can verify.

üí° Value Proposition
 ‚Ä¢ For engineers: One spec (semantics.yaml, policy.yaml) defines metrics and access once, enforced everywhere. No more drift between Snowflake, Trino, and Databricks. Lightweight adapters and OSS tooling fit directly into dbt, CI/CD, and data engineering workflows.
 ‚Ä¢ For CISOs/CDOs: A unified policy plane across all engines, with enforcement mapped to regulatory frameworks (SOX, PCI, HIPAA, EU AI Act). Every decision generates a signed receipt ‚Üí fewer audit exceptions, faster compliance prep.
 ‚Ä¢ For auditors/finance: Evidence bundles tie policies, semantics, and execution context into verifiable, signed artifacts. ‚ÄúOne metric, one policy, consistent everywhere‚Äù with proof you can file.
 ‚Ä¢ For AI agents/LLMs: A safe ‚Äúsemantic API‚Äù endpoint provides agents with metric definitions + policy-scoped SQL, ensuring agent queries are safe-by-construction.

üõ†Ô∏è MVP Scope (v0.1)

Specs (OSS-first)
 ‚Ä¢ semantics.yaml: entities, metrics, dimensional grains, constraints.
 ‚Ä¢ Bridge to dbt Semantic Layer to avoid reinvention.
 ‚Ä¢ policy.yaml: subjects, attributes, masking rules, row filters, purpose tags.
 ‚Ä¢ Includes control mappings (SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA, EU AI Act).

Adapters (read/write)
 ‚Ä¢ Catalogs: Polaris (Iceberg REST, OSS baseline), Unity Catalog (read), Nessie (read).
 ‚Ä¢ Engines:
 ‚Ä¢ Snowflake: compile to Dynamic Data Masking + Row Access Policies.
 ‚Ä¢ Databricks/Spark: Unity views + column masking UDFs.
 ‚Ä¢ Trino/Starburst: SQL rewriter + connector-level row/column filters.

Enforcement + Identity
 ‚Ä¢ Identity bridge: OIDC groups ‚Üí engine roles, attribute resolver for dept/region/purpose.
 ‚Ä¢ Approvals: lightweight TTL-based exceptions (Slack/Jira integration optional).

Evidence Journal
 ‚Ä¢ Append-only, signed decision logs:
 ‚Ä¢ decision_id, policy_id, semantic_version, engine target + artifact, identity, timestamp.
 ‚Ä¢ Regulatory control tags (SOX/PCI/etc.).
 ‚Ä¢ Verifier CLI: offline check of receipts ‚Üí JSON + human-readable SOX-mapped PDF.

Agent Endpoint (read-only, minimal)
 ‚Ä¢ API to resolve metric definitions and return policy-scoped SQL queries ‚Üí safe for LLM/agent use.

‚∏ª

üö´ Non-Goals (v0.1)
 ‚Ä¢ No new catalog (bind to Polaris/Unity/Nessie).
 ‚Ä¢ No BI tool integration (Power BI/Tableau can come later).
 ‚Ä¢ No full discovery crawler (leave that to Collibra/Alation/Atlan).
 ‚Ä¢ No Cedar backend yet (OPA/Rego only).

‚∏ª

üéØ Killer Demo (MVP narrative)
 ‚Ä¢ Stack: Iceberg tables in S3, Polaris catalog, Snowflake + Trino attached.
 ‚Ä¢ Define once: ‚ÄúActive Customer‚Äù metric in semantics.yaml + PII masking in policy.yaml.
 ‚Ä¢ Run: query from Trino client + Snowflake console ‚Üí identical metric values, masking enforced.
 ‚Ä¢ Prove: download an evidence bundle showing SOX tags, compiled artifacts, and signed receipts.

‚∏ª

üëâ This way, the MVP delivers engineer adoption hooks (OSS specs + adapters) and executive/auditor value (receipts tied to controls) from day one.
