Founder Memo: Clyra Roadmap & Strategic Vision

Date: September 2025
From: David

Clyra creates forensic evidence for data pipelines and AI agents, turning every dbt run or agent action into signed proof auditors can verify. Today that's SOX compliance. Tomorrow it enables paying people, vendors and AI agents based on verified work.

⸻

1. Why Now

Enterprises today are drowning in data changes and racing toward automation.
 • Data teams struggle with SOX/PCI/HIPAA evidence hunts, scattered lineage, and no neutral proof of what changed.
 • Finance teams burn weeks reconciling vendor/contractor payouts, with slow rails and opaque intermediaries.
 • AI/agent teams are piloting automation, but lack auditability, enforcement, or payout infrastructure.

The common thread: nobody can prove what happened, enforce safe boundaries, or tie actions to outcomes in a way auditors and finance accept.

This is the wedge Clyra owns: tamper-evident control + proof across data and automation.

2. What We Do

Clyra = Data Change Control & Attestation → Attribution → Results-Based Billing → Settlement Fabric.

One platform, phased entry:

 1. Clyra Review (Data-first, SOX/PCI wedge)
 • Listen-only: dbt hooks, ServiceNow/Jira attested change tickets.
 • Verifier CLI + “Clyra Certified — SOX Ready” badge.
 • Auditor acceptance from day one.
 2. Clyra Gate (Enforcement upsell)
 • Policy overlays: idempotency, rate caps, tenant fences, SQL safety.
 • Enforcement “off by default” until trust is built.
 3. Clyra Billing (Finance pack add-on)
 • Attribution Ledger + Graph: ties safe changes to measurable outcomes.
 • Pricing Policy Engine → invoices and billing bundles.
 • Exports to ServiceNow/Jira today; NetSuite/Stripe tomorrow.
 4. Settlement Fabric (10-year horizon)
 • Handle both stablecoin and fiat payouts.
 • Charge 0.25–0.50% per transaction.
 • Become the Visa/Mastercard equivalent for AI labor + automation payouts.

3. Roadmap

Horizon 0 (0–3 months)
 • Ship dbt hooks/macros → DEF v0 bundles.
 • Export attested tickets to ServiceNow/Jira.
 • Independent Verifier + badge program.
 • KPIs: first attested ticket ≤2 weeks, 3 design partners live, 1 paid pilot.

Horizon 1 (3–9 months)
 • Build Outcome Ledger + Attribution Certificates.
 • Deterministic attribution (last-touch, time-window).
 • Agent hooks: PEF receipts can register outcomes.
 • KPIs: 2 customers present Attribution Certificates in QBRs; ≥1 public case study.

Horizon 2 (9–18 months)
 • Pricing Policy Engine + Invoice Generator.
 • Billing bundles → export to ServiceNow/Jira; NetSuite/Stripe next.
 • Agent payouts optional (guardrails + deterministic attribution).
 • KPIs: 1–2 customers piloting outcome-linked payouts; <2% dispute rate.

Horizon 3 (18+ months)
 • Finance pack expansion → stablecoin/fiat payouts with Coinbase custody.
 • Policy templates per vertical; ERP/Workday/SAP adapters.
 • Long-term: Settlement Fabric charging 0.25–0.50% on flows.

4. Why We Win
 • Evidence vs Observability: Others show lineage; we produce signed, tamper-proof receipts.
 • Prevention vs Detection: We block unsafe changes before they land (seatbelt, not siren).
 • Independence: Neutral verifier — Snowflake/Databricks/dbt can’t credibly audit themselves.
 • Finance tie-in: Audit and payout flows converge in one chain of evidence.
 • Future-proof: Same architecture that proves dbt changes today secures AI agent actions tomorrow.

⸻

5. Market Potential
 • Data governance/observability: $2–3B market growing 15–20% CAGR.
 • Financial reconciliation/payouts: Hundreds of billions in enterprise AP spend, ripe for disruption.
 • AI agent economy: Projected to exceed $1T+ by 2035.

Clyra positions itself at the intersection: control + proof + payout.
 • 5–7 year potential: $150–250M ARR, $2–4B market cap (mid-tier SaaS multiple).
 • 10+ year potential: $1B+ ARR if Settlement Fabric vision is realized.

⸻

6. Ask / Next Step
 • Begin Horizon 0 execution: lock dbt Review MVP with 3 design partners.
 • Secure 1–2 audit partner acknowledgments for verifier.
 • Explore early finance design partner (stablecoin AP payouts).

⸻

Tagline: Proof, not just monitoring. Control, not just alerts. Payouts, not just logs.
