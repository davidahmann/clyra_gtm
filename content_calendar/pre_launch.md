# WEEK 1: "The Comfort Zone"

*Theme: "We Have dbt Docs and Warehouse Logs, We're Fine"*

## Monday, Day 1

### < Blog Post (Hero Content)

**Title:** "The Revenue Model Change That Failed SOX Audit"
**Platform:** Personal blog
**Length:** 1,200 words
**Structure:**

```
Hook: "Quarter-end close: Our dbt model changed revenue calculation.
      Tests passed. Deploy succeeded. Auditor asked: 'Show me who approved
      this change and how you can replay it.' We had Slack threads, Jira
      tickets, and QUERY_HISTORY—but nothing tied them together.
      6 weeks to reconstruct the evidence trail."

The Scattered Evidence Problem (300 words):
- Approval in Slack thread (which channel?)
- Jira ticket exists (but doesn't reference dbt run ID)
- dbt Cloud shows successful run
- Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY has the queries
- But NOTHING links them together

What We Showed the Auditor (400 words):
- Screenshot of Slack approval (but no timestamp match)
- Jira ticket ID (but no technical details)
- dbt run logs (but no approval reference)
- QUERY_HISTORY export (but no change ticket link)
- Manual spreadsheet mapping everything together

What Auditors Actually Needed (300 words):
- Change ticket with: dbt run ID, QUERY_HISTORY reference, approval record
- Schema diff showing exactly what changed
- Proof the approved change matches what deployed
- Ability to replay transformation if questioned
- All in ONE place, not scattered across 4 systems

The 6-Week Evidence Hunt (200 words):
- Week 1-2: Identify all dbt model changes that quarter
- Week 3-4: Find Slack approvals for each change
- Week 5: Match Jira tickets to dbt runs manually
- Week 6: Create evidence spreadsheet for auditor
- Controller's reaction: "This can't be our process"
```

**SEO Keywords:** SOX compliance, dbt governance, data change control
**CTA:** "Have you faced similar challenges? Share your experience."
**Distribution Timeline:**

- 9 AM: Publish on blog
- 11 AM: Submit to r/dataengineering
- 1 PM: Share on X/Twitter with thread
- 3 PM: Post in relevant Slack communities

### X/Twitter Thread

**Topic:** The audit evidence scramble (SOX quarter-end reality)
**Thread Structure:**

```
1/ Quarter-end audit. 9 AM Monday.
   Auditor: "Show me proof your dbt changes follow SOX change control."
   We had all the logs, approvals, but nothing connecting them.

2/ Evidence scattered: Slack approvals, Jira tickets, dbt Cloud runs,
   Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY - nothing links them together

3/ Spent 6 WEEKS creating spreadsheet mapping 47 model changes

4/ What auditors need: Change ticket linked to dbt run ID, approval record,
   QUERY_HISTORY reference, schema diff - in ONE place

5/ "We can't prove who changed what on the data side the way AppEng can."
   Code changes? GitHub. Data changes? Screenshot archaeology.

6/ How does your team handle data change control?

**Engagement Goal:** 50+ replies, 200+ likes
**Follow-up:** Reply to every serious response within 2 hours

### Reddit Engagement

**Target:** r/dataengineering hot posts about dbt governance
**Strategy:** 3-4 thoughtful comments
**Template Response:**

```

"Faced similar. The gap between 'what changed in dbt' and 'can you prove
it was approved' is huge. We had perfect dbt docs but couldn't
answer basic SOX questions. Ended up [specific example of manual
change tracking]. How do you handle data change control vs. monitoring?"

```

### Email List Setup

**Action:** Create simple landing page
**Headline:** "Data Change Control for Engineers"
**Copy:** "Weekly insights on dbt governance, SOX compliance, and proving what your data pipelines actually changed."
**CTA:** "Get weekly insights"

## Tuesday, Day 2

### Daily Micro-Insight (X/Twitter)

**Tweet:**

```

Your dbt model changed revenue calculation at 3:47 PM.

Or was it 3:46? Or 3:48?

Log timestamps aren't SOX evidence.

Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY = immutable audit anchor.
Much better change control proof than dbt logs.

How do you handle data governance?

```

**Include:** Screenshot of `SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();`

### Community Engagement

**Target:** dbt Community Slack
**Action:** Join and introduce briefly
**Message:** "Data platform engineer interested in governance/compliance use cases. Happy to help with dbt change control questions."

### Content Prep

**Task:** Draft Wednesday's technical tutorial
**Research:** Warehouse anchors examples, dbt governance scenarios

## Wednesday, Day 3

### < Technical Tutorial

**Title:** "Why Warehouse Logs Aren't SOX Evidence (And What Auditors Actually Need)"
**Platform:** Personal blog + r/dbt
**Length:** 800 words
**Structure:**

```

Hook: "SELECT * FROM QUERY_HISTORY; -- Is this SOX compliant?"

The Problem (200 words):

- Query logs vs. approved change evidence
- Data pipeline approval gaps
- Schema change tracking without governance
- Real examples from failed SOX audits

The Solution (400 words):

- Warehouse-native anchoring as immutable truth
- Code examples: QUERY_HISTORY and Delta commits
- Integration with dbt governance hooks
- Performance considerations for data pipelines

Implementation (200 words):
-- Code block showing warehouse anchor capture
-- Comparison with log-only approach
-- Best practices for data change control

```

**Reddit Post:** Share in r/dbt with title "Warehouse Anchors vs. Logs for SOX Compliance"
**Engagement Goal:** 75+ upvotes, expert discussion

### Technical Thread (X/Twitter)

**Topic:** Time consistency in distributed systems
**Thread:**

```

1/ "SELECT now()" in Postgres. Can you trust it?

   For observability: Yes 
   For forensic evidence: No L

   Here's why timestamps lie

2/ NTP drift example:
   App server: 14:47:32
   DB server: 14:47:28
   Log server: 14:47:35

   Which timestamp goes in your audit log?

3/ Real incident: Clock skew caused 4-minute gap
   in audit trail. Auditor flagged as "tampering."

   [Screenshot of timeline gap]

4/ Better approach: pg_current_wal_lsn()

   Immutable sequence number.
   Can't drift, can't be manipulated.
   Perfect forensic anchor point.

5/ Code example: Capturing LSN in audit logs
   [Code screenshot]

   Now your evidence is anchored to database truth,
   not wall clock time.

6/ How do you handle audit trail consistency
   across distributed systems? 

```

### Reddit Engagement

**Target:** r/devops posts about monitoring/logging
**Focus:** Share timestamp/LSN insights in relevant threads

## Thursday, Day 4

### Daily Insight

**Tweet:**

```

Incident response reality check:

"The logs show we processed 10,847 refunds"
 "We can prove exactly which 10,847 refunds"

"Error rate spiked at 2:47 PM"
 "Here's deterministic replay of the 2:47 PM failure"

Observability vs. Evidence.
There's a difference.

```

### Community Building

**Action:** Answer 2-3 PostgreSQquestions on Stack Overflow
**Focus:** WAL, LSN, audit logging topics
**Goal:** Build technical credibility

### Content Prep

**Task:** Research Friday's thread topic (hash chains)
**Collect:** Real examples of log tampering cases

## Friday, Day 5

### Technical Thread

**Topic:** Log integrity and tamper evidence
**Thread:**

```

1/ Your audit logs can be tampered with.

   Here's how attackers do it,
   and how to build tamper-evident logs

2/ Common attack: Direct log file modification

   sed -i 's/FAILED/SUCCESS/g' audit.log

   Who would know?
B

3/ Better: Hash chains

   Each log entry includes hash of previous entry.
   Modify one entry breaks entire chain.

   [Diagram of hash chain]

4/ Even better: Merkle trees

   Tamper with any entry
   Root hash changes
   Immediately detectable

   [Code example]

5/ Best: Cryptographic signatures

   Sign each entry with private key.
   Verifiable by anyone with public key.
   Non-repudiation + integrity.

6/ Real question: How do you prove your logs
   haven't been tampered with?

   Screenshots? Digital signatures? Honor system? 

```

## Tuesday, Day 9

### < Blog Post + OSS Release (MAJOR)

**Title:** "How to Tie Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY to a ServiceNow Change Ticket"
**Platform:** Personal blog
**Length:** 1,000 words
**Structure:**

```

Hook: "Your dbt run succeeded. Now prove it was approved and attach
      the evidence to a change ticket auditors will accept."

The Scattered Evidence Problem (250 words):

- dbt run succeeds in dbt Cloud
- Approval happened in Slack/GitHub PR
- QUERY_HISTORY in Snowflake has the proof
- ServiceNow/Jira ticket exists
- Nothing connects them

What Auditors Need in the Ticket (300 words):
Fields to capture:

- change_id (unique identifier)
- dbt_run_id (from dbt Cloud/Core)
- query_history_ref (Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY query_id)
- approver (SSO identity or GitHub username)
- schema_diff (JSON showing what changed)
- timestamp (when change executed)

Example ServiceNow Payload (200 words):
[JSON example showing all required fields]
[Screenshots of populated ticket]

Example Jira Payload (200 words):
[JSON example for Jira custom fields]
[How to create custom issue type for data changes]

The Bridge Script (50 words):
"I've open-sourced a simple bash script that does this.
No dependencies. Works with dbt Cloud webhooks or on_run_end hooks."

```

## Wednesday, Day 10

### Technical Thread

**Topic:** Database forensics techniques
**Thread:**

```

1/ Your database was corrupted at 14:47 yesterday.

   Can you prove:
    Exactly what changed?
    Which automation caused it?
    How to prevent it happening again?

2/ Most teams have:
   Application logs (what was requested)
   Database logs (what was attempted)
   Monitoring alerts (symptoms detected)

   Missing: What actually changed L

3/ Database forensics checklist:

    Warehouse-anchored snapshots (QUERY_HISTORY, Delta commits)
    Deterministic state diffs
    Tamper-evident evidence chains
    Replay capability for validation

4/ Example: Corrupted customer record

   [Code showing LSN capture + diff]

   Now you can prove exactly what changed,
   when, and replay the incident deterministically.

5/ The real test: Could you demonstrate
   your incident response to an auditor?

   Screenshots vs. cryptographic proof? 

```

## Tuesday, Day 16

### < Blog Post + OSS Release (Major)

**Title:** "Quarter-End Without Screenshots: A Practical Evidence Bundle Format"
**Platform:** Personal blog + HackerNews submission
**Length:** 1,200 words
**Structure:**

```

Hook: "Auditors don't want screenshots. They want structured, verifiable
      evidence they can validate independently. Here's the format that works."

The Screenshot Problem (300 words):

- Quarter-end: exporting 200+ screenshots from 4 systems
- Auditor can't verify screenshots haven't been doctored
- No way to validate evidence is complete
- Manual correlation is error-prone and time-consuming
- Controller spent 6 weeks preparing evidence package

What Auditors Actually Need (400 words):

- Structured evidence bundle (JSON + NDJSON)
- Manifest file listing all changes
- Receipts for each operation with:
  - change_id, dbt_run_id, query_history_ref
  - approver identity, timestamp, schema_diff
- References to source systems (Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY, GitHub commits)
- Verification instructions they can run independently

The Minimal Evidence Bundle Format (400 words):
Example structure:

- manifest.json (bundle metadata, change count, date range)
- receipts/ (one NDJSON file per change with full details)
- references/ (links to QUERY_HISTORY, GitHub, ServiceNow)
- verify.sh (simple script auditors can run to validate)

[JSON schema examples throughout]

The Open Source Format (100 words):
"I've open-sourced the minimal evidence bundle spec.
Vendor-neutral. Anyone can implement it. Auditors can verify
it independently without trusting any vendor."

```

**GitHub Release:** data-change-control/evidence-bundle-spec
Files:
- schema/manifest-v1.json (JSON Schema for manifest)
- schema/receipt-v1.json (JSON Schema for receipts)
- examples/ (sample bundles from dbt/Snowflake scenarios)
- verifier-stub.go (simple verification tool)
- docs/auditor-guide.md (how auditors validate bundles)

**SEO Keywords:** evidence bundle, sox compliance, data audit trail
**HackerNews Submission:** Tuesday 9 AM PT

### Launch Thread

**Topic:** HN submission amplification
**Thread:**

```

1/ Just published: "Your Auditor Asked for Proof.
   You Gave Them Dashboards."

   The compliance gap most teams discover too late

   [Link to HN submission]

2/ Real scenario: PCI audit

   QSA: "Show me the change ticket for this schema update"
   Us: [Searches through 47 Jira tickets and 12 Slack threads]
   QSA: "This proves process, not technical changes"

3/ The gap between observability and evidence:

   Monitoring tells you WHAT happened
   Evidence proves WHY you can trust it

   Auditors need proof, not dashboards.

4/ Building forensic systems means designing
   for evidence from day 1:

    Tamper-evident logs
    Deterministic replay
    Independent verification
    Cryptographic signatures

5/ Comments and feedback appreciated!
   What's your biggest compliance evidence challenge?

```

## Wednesday, Day 17

### Technical Thread

**Topic:** Compliance automation pitfalls
**Thread:**

```

1/ "We automated PCI compliance!"

   Translation: "We automated PCI documentation."

   Compliance ` Documentation
   Evidence ` Reports

2/ Common mistake: Automated checkbox reports

    "Logs are encrypted"
    "Access is monitored"
    "Changes are tracked"

   But can you PROVE any of this? 

3/ Real audit questions:

   "Show me tamper-evident proof of log integrity"
   "Demonstrate your change tracking works"
   "Prove this encryption claim"

   Screenshots don't count.

4/ Evidence-based compliance:

    Cryptographically signed audit logs
    Deterministic replay of changes
    Independent verification tools
    Immutable evidence chains

5/ The test: Could you prove your compliance
   claims to a hostile auditor who trusts
   nothing but mathematics?

   If not, you have documentation, not evidence.

```

## Friday, Day 19

### Technical Deep-Dive Thread

**Topic:** Building tamper-evident audit systems
**Thread:**

```

1/ Building audit logs that auditors actually trust:

   Not just append-only files.
   Not just encrypted storage.

   Cryptographically tamper-evident systems

2/ Level 1: Hash chains

   entry_n_hash = hash(entry_n + entry_n-1_hash)

   Tamper with any entry chain breaks
   Immediately detectable

   [Code example]

3/ Level 2: Merkle trees

   Efficient integrity verification
   Can prove any subset without full tree
   Used in blockchain, Git, etc.

   [Diagram]

4/ Level 3: Digital signatures

   Sign each entry with private key
   Anyone can verify with public key
   Non-repudiation guarantee

   [Code example]

5/ Real implementation: Postgres + Go

   [Code showing LSN + signature integration]

   Now your audit logs are mathematically
   tamper-evident. Auditors love math.

6/ Question: What level of evidence do your
   audit systems provide? Screenshots or
   cryptographic proof? 

### < Blog Post + OSS Release (MAJOR)

**Title:** "Why dbt Tests Aren't SOX Change Control (And What To Do Instead)"
**Platform:** Personal blog
**Length:** 1,200 words
**Structure:**

```

Hook: "Your dbt tests passed. Great! But that proves correctness, not authorization.
      Auditors need to know: who approved this change and where's the proof?"

Why Tests ≠ Approvals (300 words):

- dbt tests validate data quality
- Tests prove "the model works correctly"
- Tests don't prove "the change was approved"
- Auditors ask: "Who authorized this schema change?"
- Your answer: "The tests passed..." ❌

What SOX ITGC Actually Requires (400 words):

- Segregation of duties: developer ≠ approver
- Change approval BEFORE deployment
- Audit trail linking approval -> deployment
- Evidence attached to change ticket
- Ability to demonstrate controls work

The dbt SOX Pattern (400 words):
on_run_end hooks that:

1. Emit dbt manifest + run metadata
2. Capture schema diff (before/after)
3. Reference approval (GitHub PR, Jira ticket)
4. Attach evidence to ServiceNow/Jira ticket
5. Generate receipt for audit trail

Example on_run_end macro [code sample]
What gets captured [JSON example]
Where it goes [ServiceNow/Jira integration]

The Open Source Implementation (100 words):
"I've open-sourced dbt hooks that emit SOX-ready evidence.
Drop into any dbt project. Works with dbt Cloud or Core.
Integrates with the evidence bundle format from Week 3."

### Technical Deep-Dive Thread

**Topic:** Deterministic database replay techniques
**Thread:**

```

1/ "We deployed the model"

   Great! Can you prove it was approved?
   Can you replay the transformation to validate it?

   Deterministic replay "it worked in dev"

2/ Problem: Non-deterministic data change reproduction

   Different timestamps each run
   External API responses vary
   Concurrent operations interfere
   Environmental differences

3/ Solution: Controlled replay environment

    Isolated database schema
    Mocked external dependencies
    Fixed timestamp injection
    Single-threaded execution

1/ Building deterministic replay into your systems:

   Not as complex as it sounds.
   More valuable than you might think

2/ Step 1: Isolate replay environment

   CREATE SCHEMA replay_20250201_1430;

   Completely separate from production.
   No risk, no interference.

3/ Step 2: Capture precise state

   Metadata snapshots at exact moments:

- Schema definitions
- Table row counts
- Aggregate checksums
- WALSN positions

4/ Step 3: Deterministic execution

   [Code showing controlled replay]

   Fixed timestamps, mocked externals,
   single-threaded operations.

5/ Step 4: Mathematical validation

   Compare:
   Expected state vs. Actual state
   Expected operations vs. Executed operations
   Expected outcomes vs. Measured outcomes

6/ Result: You can prove your systems work
   the way you think they do.

   Not hope. Not believe. Prove.

   How do you validate your fixes? 

## Tuesday, Day 37

### < Blog Post (MAJOR)

**Title:** "Jira vs ServiceNow for Data Change Control: A Practical Guide"
**Platform:** Personal blog + r/dataengineering
**Length:** 1,400 words
**Structure:**

```

Hook: "Your data changes need change tickets. But should you use
      Jira or ServiceNow? The answer depends on who owns SOX compliance."

Why Change Tickets Matter for SOX ITGC (250 words):

- SOX requires documented change control process
- Tickets provide audit trail
- Approvals must be linked to technical changes
- ITGC walkthrough = auditor reviews tickets
- Data teams often exempt themselves (mistake!)

Modeling Data Changes in ServiceNow (500 words):
Required fields for data change tickets:

- change_id (unique, auto-generated)
- change_type (schema, model, activation)
- dbt_run_id (from dbt Cloud/Core)
- query_history_ref (Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY query_id)
- approver (SSO identity)
- schema_diff (JSON attachment showing before/after)
- risk_level (based on tables affected: revenue, PII, etc.)

Integration pattern:

- dbt on_run_end hook -> evidence bundle -> ServiceNow REST API
- Example payload [JSON]
- Screenshot of populated ticket
- Approval workflow configuration

Modeling Data Changes in Jira (500 words):
Custom issue type: "Data Change"
Custom fields needed:

- dbt Run ID (text field)
- Query History Link (URfield)
- Schema Diff (attachment or JSON in description)
- Approved By (user picker)
- Environment (prod/staging)

Integration pattern:

- dbt hook -> evidence bundle -> Jira API
- Example payload [JSON]
- Screenshot of custom issue
- Automation rules for approval flow

Which To Choose (150 words):
ServiceNow if:

- Enterprise with existing ITGC workflows
- SOX compliance team already uses ServiceNow
- Need integration with broader IT change control

Jira if:

- Mid-market, developer-native culture
- Data team wants ownership of process
- Lower friction, faster adoption
- Existing Jira for eng work

```

**Updated GitHub Release:** data-change-control/servicenow-jira-bridge
New files added:
- docs/servicenow-setup-guide.md (detailed setup)
- docs/jira-custom-fields.md (field configuration)
- examples/workflows/ (approval automation examples)

**SEO Keywords:** servicenow data governance, jira data change control
**Distribution:** Blog -> r/dataengineering -> r/dbt -> Newsletter

### Technical Launch Thread

**Topic:** "Jira vs ServiceNow for dbt teams: here's how to choose"
**Focus:** When to use each platform + setup guides

## Wednesday, Day 38

### Advanced Technical Thread

**Topic:** State capture techniques
**Thread:**

```

1/ Database state capture for replay:

   Naive approach: Full database dump
   Smart approach: Metadata + checksums
   Expert approach: WALSN anchoring

2/ Why full dumps are problematic:

   Massive storage requirements
   Slow capture/restore times
   Contains sensitive data
   Doesn't scale

3/ Metadata-only approach:

    Table schemas + row counts
    Aggregate checksums by table
    Index definitions and stats
    WALSN for precise moment

4/ Implementation example:

   [Code showing metadata capture]

   Fast, lightweight, privacy-preserving,
   sufficient for deterministic replay.

5/ The key insight: You don't need all data,
   just enough to detect state changes
   and anchor replay to exact moments.

   WALSN = immutable timestamp.

6/ How do you handle state capture
   in your systems? Full dumps or
   something smarter? 

```

### Community Technical Discussion

**Platform:** PostgreSQcommunity forums
**Topic:** Share WALSN techniques for audit/replay

## Thursday, Day 39

*Theme: "The Data Governance Solution Exists (Almost)"*

## Monday, Day 43

### Daily Insight

**Tweet:**

```

Aviation transformed safety with black boxes.

Every commercial flight has:
 Voice recorder
 Flight data recorder

### < Blog Post (Major)

**Title:** "Why Data Teams Will Own AI Agent Governance (And How to Prepare)"
**Platform:** Personal blog + HackerNews
**Length:** 1,100 words
**Structure:**

```

Hook: "Your data team already solves change control, approvals, and audit trails
      for dbt. AI agents need the exact same governance—just faster."

Data Platform Change Control Today (300 words):
The patterns you already know:

- dbt model change -> GitHub PR approval -> deploy -> ServiceNow ticket
- Activation sync -> approval check -> push to Salesforce -> evidence bundle
- Schema migration -> change ticket -> SOX compliance trail

You've solved:

- Who approved this change?
- What exactly changed?
- Where's the proof for auditors?
- How do we replay if questioned?

AI Agent Operations Tomorrow (300 words):
Same patterns, different systems:

- Agent writes to Salesforce -> needs approval check
- Agent generates contract -> needs evidence trail
- Agent processes refund -> needs audit proof
- Agent updates billing -> needs SOX compliance

The problems are identical:

- Approval workflows
- Evidence generation
- Audit trails
- Replay capability

The Architecture That Serves Both (400 words):
Single control point (Gateway pattern):

- Validates requests before execution
- Enforces approval requirements
- Generates evidence automatically
- Works for dbt runs AND agent actions

Unified evidence format:

- Same bundle structure for data + agents
- Same ServiceNow/Jira integration
- Same auditor validation process
- One system to learn, applies everywhere

Progressive adoption path:

- Week 1-4: Deploy for dbt (low risk, learn the system)
- Week 5-8: Add activation controls (higher value)
- Month 3+: Expand to AI agents (when ready)
- Same architecture, expanding scope

Why Data Teams Should Lead This (100 words):

- You already understand change control
- You already integrate with SOX processes
- You already have budget for "data governance"
- You can expand scope to agents without creating new category
- CFO already trusts your dbt governance process

```

**HackerNews Submission:** Tuesday 9 AM PT
**Title:** "Why Data Teams Will Own AI Agent Governance"

### Launch Thread

**Topic:** "Data teams are best positioned to own AI agent governance. Here's why."
**Focus:** Same patterns, same tools, expanding scope

## Wednesday, Day 45

### Technical Vision Thread

**Topic:** Evidence-first architecture principles
**Thread:**

```

1/ What if we designed systems for evidence
   from day 1?

   Not observability-first.
   Not performance-first.
   Evidence-first

2/ Current architecture priorities:

   1. Functionality
   2. Performance
   3. Observability
   4. Evidence (if at all)

3/ Evidence-first architecture priorities:

   1. Functionality
   2. Evidence/Auditability
   3. Performance
   4. Advanced observability

4/ Design principles:

    Every state change is recorded
    All records are tamper-evident
    Replay is built-in, not retrofitted
    Evidence export is standardized

5/ Technical requirements:

    Warehouse-anchored snapshots (QUERY_HISTORY, Delta commits)
    Hash-chained operation logs
    Digital signature capabilities
    Isolated replay environments

6/ Business benefits:

    Faster incident resolution
    Auditor confidence
    Customer trust
    Regulatory compliance

7/ The question: Would you design differently
   if evidence was a first-class requirement?

   What would change in your architecture? 

```

### Reddit Architecture Discussion

## Thursday, Day 46

### Daily Insight

**Tweet:**

```

Software architecture evolution:

1990s: Functionality-first
2000s: Performance-first
2010s: Scale-first
2020s: Observability-first
2025: Evidence-first?

Each era solved real problems.
What problem does evidence solve?

```

### Community Building

**Action:** Start GitHub gist with "Evidence-First Design Principles"
**Purpose:** Central resource for community discussion

## Friday, Day 47

### Technical Manifesto Thread

**Topic:** The future of auditable systems
**Thread:**

```

1/ The Evidence-First Manifesto

   Software systems should be:
   Provable, not just observable
   Replayable, not just recoverable
   Auditable, not just monitored

2/ Core principles:

    Every operation leaves evidence
    Evidence is cryptographically protected
    Systems can prove their own behavior
    Audits are automated, not manual

3/ Technical implementation:

   Database: Warehouse anchoring (QUERY_HISTORY, Delta commits)
   Application: Hash-chained audit logs
   Storage: Digital signatures
   Verification: Independent tools
   Replay: Isolated environments

4/ Why this matters now:

    AI systems need explainability
    Regulations demand evidence
    Customers require trust
    Incidents are increasingly costly

5/ Open source approach:

   Evidence formats should be standardized
   Verification tools should be independent
   No vendor lock-in for trust
   Community-driven development

6/ The vision: Every production system
   has a "flight recorder."

   Every incident is fully replayable.
   Every audit is mathematically provable.

   Agree? What would you change? 

## Tuesday, Day 51

### < Final Blog Post + OSS Release

**Title:** "The SOX Data Change Control Checklist (Steal This)"
**Platform:** Personal blog
**Length:** 1,400 words
**Structure:**

```

Hook: "Your dbt project can be SOX compliant in 3 hours. Here's the
      checklist auditors accept. Steal it. Use it. Ship it."

The 6-Week Problem (200 words):

- Quarter-end audit prep: 6-8 weeks of manual work
- Evidence scattered across 4 systems
- Controller stressed, data team frustrated
- Auditor asks same questions every quarter
- This shouldn't be your process

The 3-Hour Solution (1,000 words):

[ ] Change Approval Process (Week 1)
  v dbt PRs require approval from designated reviewer
  v Approval recorded in GitHub (commit SHA binding)
  v No direct prod deploys without approval
  v Role matrix documented (developer ≠ approver ≠ deployer)

  [Example: GitHub CODEOWNERS file]
  [Example: Branch protection rules]

[ ] Evidence Collection (Week 2)
  v dbt on_run_end hooks emit manifest + metadata
  v Snowflake/Databricks QUERY_HISTORY captured post-run
  v Schema diff generated (before/after)
  v Evidence attached to ServiceNow/Jira ticket

  [Use our OSS dbt hooks from Week 5]
  [Use our ServiceNow/Jira bridge from Week 2]

[ ] Segregation of Duties (Week 3)
  v Separate roles: developer, approver, deployer
  v Role assignments documented
  v Access logs captured
  v Quarterly review of role assignments

  [Example: Role matrix spreadsheet]

[ ] Daily Review Ritual (Week 4)
  v Failed approvals reviewed (15 min daily standup item)
  v High-risk changes flagged (revenue tables, PII columns)
  v Anomalies escalated (unusual schema changes)
  v Evidence bundle completeness checked

  [SQqueries for daily review dashboard]

[ ] Quarterly Audit Prep (Ongoing)
  v Export evidence bundles (not screenshots!)
  v Provide verification instructions to auditor
  v < 5 days prep time (vs. 6-8 weeks before)
  v Controller can validate completeness anytime

  [Example: Evidence bundle export script]

Implementation Timeline (200 words):

- Day 1-7: Set up approval roles + GitHub integration
- Day 8-14: Install dbt hooks + ServiceNow/Jira bridge
- Day 15-21: Document segregation of duties
- Day 22-28: Establish daily review ritual
