Clyra — Why We’re Different

1. Pain (what customers feel today)
 • “We’ve got dashboards, logs, and dbt metadata… but when audit asks who changed the revenue model and whether it was approved, we scramble through Slack threads and Jira tickets.”
 • Audits become 6–8 week fire drills. Evidence is scattered, partial, and unverifiable.
 • Observability tools alert after the fact. Governance add-ons from Snowflake/dbt are helpful, but they’re tied to one vendor and not independent.

⸻

2. Solution (what Clyra does)
 • Evidence, not just alerts
Every schema change, dbt run, or pipeline update produces a tamper-proof receipt — signed, replayable, and mapped directly to SOX, PCI, HIPAA, EU AI Act.
 • Prevention, not detection
Think seatbelt, not siren. Unsafe or out-of-policy changes can be blocked before hitting prod. But enforcement is off-by-default — you start in “listen-only” Review mode and graduate to Gate once trust is built.
 • Audit-ready from day one
Instead of 3-month evidence hunts, export an “Attested Change Ticket” straight into ServiceNow or Jira. Auditors see the format they already know.
 • Platform-independent proof
Works across dbt, Snowflake, Databricks, Postgres. Your evidence survives platform churn or vendor lock-in.
 • Built for what’s next
The same controls protecting dbt pipelines today will protect AI agents tomorrow when they start writing to CRMs, finance systems, or contracts.

3. Proof (why believe us)
 • ROI: Turn 6–8 weeks of audit prep into a 2-day export.
 • Risk reduction: Stop unsafe writes, unbounded ETLs, and out-of-policy schema changes before they hit production.
 • Adoption path: 10-minute quickstart → dbt Cloud webhook → evidence bundle in ServiceNow/Jira. No re-platforming required.
 • Independent verifier: Auditors can validate receipts offline with our open-source CLI.

⸻

4. Differentiation (vs status quo)
 • Not just lineage — dashboards tell you what probably changed. We give you signed receipts you can replay and defend in an audit.
 • Not passive monitoring — observability tools wake you up at 2 a.m. after damage is done. We prevent the unsafe change in the first place.
 • Not vendor-lock governance — Snowflake/dbt features are tied to their platform. We certify changes across platforms.
 • Not overkill — enterprises already spend weeks and $$ reconstructing audit evidence. With Clyra, it’s instant.

⸻

5. Future-Proofing (why act now)
 • Data today, agents tomorrow: The governance gaps in dbt pipelines are the same ones GenAI agents will exploit. Fixing them now hardens you for both.
 • Badge effect: Projects passing Clyra checks get a “Clyra Certified — SOX Ready” badge. This becomes the de-facto standard auditors ask for.

⸻

🔑 Bottom line:
Others tell stories. Clyra provides tamper-proof receipts and preemptive safety — trusted by auditors, adopted by data teams, and ready for the agentic wave.Clyra — Why We’re Different
